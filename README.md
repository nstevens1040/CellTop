# &#9888; Caution &#9888;
This app tests your download speed **indefinitely**. That means that it literally starts a download that **DOES NOT STOP** until you close the app.  
## Use case
Really anything that involves measuring the performance and/or gathering the details of your cellular connection.  

For example, you signed up for a cellular home internet service and you need to know where, in your home, your cellular connection performs the best.  

## Output
In addition to the screenshot below, the app also writes a csv file that gets saved in ```/Android/data/org.nanick.cellconnection/files/``` as ```$(epochTimeStamp).csv```.
